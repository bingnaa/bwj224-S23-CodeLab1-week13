# Final Project

Used lists, arrays, and UI Scriptable Objects to navigate the scene and create a sort "UI" game for the different class lessons.
If I had more time, I would figure out the timer/timing issue with the "English" game. Would also add more classes/games and an ending scene: what happens if you lose all lives vs. what happens when you defeat all the games. Also more "weird" stuff happening when you lose lives.

Camera settings were pulled from the Unity Asset Store. [https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/crt-free-248066]
